# :link:BBLinq
The current state of ORMs does not allow interaction between an application and a database when there's a piece of software acting as a middle-man, 
such as BlockBase. BBLinq solves this issue by providing a fluent API able to produce, sign and emit database queries through HTTP, lin*q*ing you 
database, BlockBase node and application together.

This repository contains the current build (v0.0.2). For the latest working version, [click here](https://github.com/blockbasenetwork/bblinq/tree/v0.0.1)
